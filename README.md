# 2022-Midterm-Polling-Data-in-R
Scraped and cleaned polling data for each race then created a data frame with each state, who is ahead, and the averaging polling difference. This was done to teach myself R as well as the basics of web scraping.

output.csv contains the output as of January 17th and is saved as a record in case the polling data is removed.

All polling information was taken from 270towin.com and is no longer updated as the races have concluded.
